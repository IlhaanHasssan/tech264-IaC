### What is IaC?
**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is a method to manage and provision computing infrastructure using machine-readable configuration files, rather than manual processes.

### Benefits of IaC?
- **Consistency**: Reduces human error by automating setup processes.
- **Speed**: Faster deployment of infrastructure.
- **Scalability**: Easily replicate environments.
- **Version control**: Configuration can be versioned and tracked.
- **Collaboration**: Enables collaboration by treating infrastructure like software code.

### When/where to use IaC?
- **Cloud environments**: To manage resources in public or private clouds.
- **DevOps practices**: To automate and streamline infrastructure provisioning.
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Automate deployment and infrastructure management.

### What are the tools available for IaC?
- **Terraform**
- **AWS CloudFormation**
- **Pulumi**
- **Ansible**
- **Chef**
- **Puppet**

### What is configuration management (CM)?
**Configuration Management (CM)** is the practice of managing and maintaining the desired state of an organization's infrastructure, ensuring systems are configured correctly and consistently.

### What is provisioning of infrastructure? Do CM tools do it?
**Provisioning of infrastructure** refers to the process of setting up and configuring resources such as servers, networks, and storage. **Yes**, some CM tools like Ansible, Chef, and Puppet can also handle infrastructure provisioning in addition to configuration management.

### What is Ansible and how does it work?
**Ansible** is an open-source automation tool for configuration management, application deployment, and infrastructure provisioning. It works by using **playbooks** (YAML files) to define automation tasks, and it operates agentlessly over SSH or PowerShell.

### Who is using IaC and Ansible in the industry?
- **Tech companies** (e.g., Google, Facebook)
- **Cloud providers** (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure)
- **Financial services** (e.g., Capital One)
- **E-commerce** (e.g., Amazon)
- **Telecommunications** (e.g., AT&T)
